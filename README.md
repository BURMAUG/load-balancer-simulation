# Simple Load Balancer Simulation 

### Introduction
This is a simulations of the implementation of the software Load Balancer that routes TCP network calls to different
running instances for our radius calculating server in a multithreaded manner.

### Enhancements Coming
- Round-Robin routing
- Sticky Round-Robin routing
- Health Checks

### Issues
- Faults
- Thread sleeps to avoid collisions
- Probable unnecessary use of locks

### Technologies Used
- Java
- Socket and ServerSockets
- Threads using Runnable interface
